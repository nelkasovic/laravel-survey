# Laravel Survey
Create and manage surveys within your Laravel app.
I decided to fork this one `https://github.com/matt-daneshvar/laravel-survey` and modify to fit project needs.  

## Installation
Require the package using composer.
```bash
composer require wimando/laravel-survey
```

Publish package migrations.
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Wimando\Survey\SurveyServiceProvider" --tag="migrations" 
```

Run the migrations to create all survey tables.
```bash
php artisan migrate 
```

## Usage

### Creating a Survey

Creating a new `Survey` is easy! You can build your survey fluently just like 
how you create all your `Eloquent` models in your app.  
```php
$survey = SurveyFactory::create(['name' => 'Cat Population Survey']);

$survey->save();

$survey->questions()->create([
     'content' => 'How many cats do you have?',
     'type' => 'number',
     'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
 ]);

$survey->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'What\'s the name of your first cat',
]);

$survey->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'Would you want a new cat?',
    'type' => 'radio',
    'options' => ['Yes', 'Oui']
]);
```

#### Creating Multiple Sections
You may also park your questions under multiple sections.
```php
$survey = SurveyFactory::create(['name' => 'Cat Population Survey']);

$survey->save();

$one = $survey->sections()->create(['name' => 'Part One']);

$one->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'How many cats do you have?',
    'type' => 'number',
    'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
]);

$two = $survey->sections()->create(['name' => 'Part Two']);

$two->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'What\'s the name of your first cat?',
]);

$two->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'Would you want a new cat?',
    'type' => 'radio',
    'options' => ['Yes', 'Oui']
]);
```

### Creating an Entry

#### From an Array
The `Entry` model comes with a `fromArray` function.  
This is especially useful when you're creating an entry from a form submission. 
```php
$entry = EntryFactory::create();

$entry->for($survey)->fromArray([
    'q1' => 'Yes',
    'q2' => 5
])->push();
```

#### By a Specific User
You may fluently specify the participant using the `by()` function.
```php
$entry = EntryFactory::create();

$entry->for($survey)->by($user)->fromArray($answers)->push();
```

### Setting Constraints
When creating your survey, you may set some constraints 
to be enforced every time a new `Entry` is being created.

#### Allowing Guest Entries
By default, `Entry` models require a `participant_id` when being created. 
If you wish to change this behaviour and accept guest entries,
set the `accept-guest-entries` option on your `Survey` model.  
```php
SurveyFactory::create(['settings' => ['accept-guest-entries' => true]]);
```

#### Adjusting Entries Per Participant Limit
All `Survey` models default to accept only **1 entry** per unique participant.
You may adjust the `limit-per-participant` option on your `Survey` model 
or set it to `-1` to remove this limit altogether.    
```php
SurveyFactory::create(['settings' => ['limit-per-participant' => 1]]);
```
*Note that this setting will be ignored if the `accept-guest-entries` option is activated.*

### Validation

#### Defining Validation Rules
Add in a `rules` attribute when you're creating your `Question` to specify the validation logic 
for the answers being received. 
```php
QuestionFactory::create([
    'content' => 'How many cats do you have?', 
    'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
]);
```
*Note that as opposed to the survey constraints, the question validators 
are not automatically triggered during the entry creation process. 
To validate the answers, you should manually run the validation in your controller (see below)* 

#### Validating Submissions
Validate user's input against the entire rule set of your `Survey` using Laravel's built in validator.
```php
class SurveyEntriesController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Survey $survey, Request $request)
    {
        $answers = $this->validate($request, $survey);
        
        $entry = EntryFactory::create();
        
        $entry->for($survey)->fromArray($answers)->push();
    }
}
```

### Views
Out of the box this package comes with boilerplate Bootstrap 4.0 views 
to display the surveys and some basic question types. 
These views are meant to be used only as samples, and 
are not expected to replace your views in production.
To display survey in a card, include the `card` partial in your views.

```blade
@include('survey::standard', ['survey' => $survey])
``` 

#### Customizing the Views
To customize the boilerplate views shipped with this package run `package:publish` with the `views` tag.
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Wimando\Survey\SurveyServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```
This will create a new `vendor/wimando/survey` directory 
where you can fully customize the survey views to your liking.

### Road Map
- [ ] Allow configuration.
- [ ] Generalize participant relation in `Entry`.
- [ ] Add weight to options.
- [ ] Implement wizard + section pagination!
- [ ] Support anonymized entries.
- [ ] Add management dashboard.
